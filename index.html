  <p>In the former days I owned of a fleet of trucks. It all started with <a href="Images/My First Truck - Copy.jpg">1 truck</a>, which of course I drove.
    Soon I had multiple trucks and multiple contractors driving the trucks.
    During that time I learned the trucking business from top to bottom.
    Also during this time I saw the way in which <a href="Images\2021080_univ_lsr_lg - Copy.jpg">my wife</a> loved her business, loved helping her customers and
    how her very many customers loved her business as well!
    They were <a href="Images\2021080_univ_lsr_lg - Copy.jpg">appreciative</a> of her expertise!
    Not only that but there is an entire community of kind and generous people of which she is a part.
    So I sold my Trucking business 1 truck at a time until I was free of it! It served its purpose. I learned a lot. </p>

  <p> Today, who I am, what I am, and where I am is by choice. No longer am I making the best of what has been offered,
    no, but I am choosing my adventure.
    I have decided that now is the time to pursue the carreer that I, for many years, have wanted but never had the time to pursue.
    My new adventure! building software! To me building software is fun and exciting and somehow serves an, as of yet, unnamed something within me!
    Therefore, I have set out to build software that will help to streamline my wifes efforts so we can spend more time <a href="Images\2021080_univ_lsr_lg - Copy.jpg">together</a>!</p>
